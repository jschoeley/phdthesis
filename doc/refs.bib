Mortality plateaus result from multiplicative (proportional) and additive hazards, but not from accelerated failure time models. Frailty can have any distribution with regularly-varying-at-0 density and the distribution of frailty among survivors to each subsequent age converges to a gamma distribution. In a multiplicative setting the baseline cumulative hazard can be represented as the inverse of the negative logarithm of any completely monotone function. If the plateau is reached, the only meaningful solution at the plateau is provided by the gamma-Gompertz model.},

Objective: We wish to discuss assumptions and limitations of the original Strehler-Mildvan model (as well as of the Strehler-Mildvan correlation) and consider some modifications and departures from this model. Methods: We use the framework of stochastic point processes for analyzing the original Strehler-Mildvan model. We also suggest the 'lifesaving approach' for describing the departure from rectangularization to shifts in survival curves for human mortality that has been observed in the second half of the previous century. Results: We show that the Strehler-Mildvan model can be justified only under the additional assumption that the process of shocks (demands for energy) follows the Poisson pattern. We also suggest a modification that accounts for the oldest-old mortality plateau.},

The field of evolutionary demography has long focused on understanding the evolution of senescence while largely failing to address the evolution of ontogenescence. The current review is the first to gather the few available hypotheses addressing the evolution of ontogenescence, examine the basis and assumptions of each and ask what the phylogenetic extent of ontogenescence may be. Ontogenescence is among the most widespread of life-history traits, occurring in every population for which I have found sufficiently detailed data, in major groups throughout the eukaryotes, across many causes of death and many life-history types. Hypotheses seeking to explain ontogenescence include those based on kin selection, the acquisition of robustness, heterogeneous frailties and life-history optimization. I propose a further hypothesis, arguing that mortality drops with age because most transitions that could trigger the risks caused by genetic and developmental malfunctions are concentrated in early life. Of these hypotheses, only those that frame ontogenescence as an evolutionary by-product rather than an adaptation can explain the tremendous diversity of organisms and environments in which it occurs.},

About half of all first-day deaths in liveborn babies occurred during the first 4 hours. More than half of all first-week deaths happened during the first day. More than half of all deaths from 31 weeks to 76 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) were either fetal deaths prior to the onset of labour unexplained by fetal factors or unexplained sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths. Graphic presentation of feto-infant mortality distributed on functional cause-of-death groups improved the expression of the relative contribution and timing of the different causes of deaths. Despite a high autopsy rate and a uniform coding practice the distribution on causes of deaths from register data should be interpreted with caution. Full use of the feto-infant approach is only achieved with data which include late abortions. Thus the feto-infant approach is of special interest in countries which have registers of live births and fetal deaths from week 22 of gestation or earlier. The integration of the life table approach and analysis of underlying causes of deaths should be further explored as a way of utilizing vital statistic databases for the evaluation of perinatal care.},

Rate is generally accepted as measuring risk, but since it is the population of undelivered, not delivered, infants that is at risk of intrauterine death, stillbirth risk would be better measured as the number of impending stillbirths divided by the total number of undelivered fetuses. With this measure the risk of unexplained stillbirth was least in preterm pregnancies, rising fourfold after 39 weeks to a maximum at 41 weeks.

It can be used for univariate (independent) failure times, i.e. to describe the influence of unobserved covariates in a proportional hazards model. More interesting, however, is to consider multivariate (dependent) failure times generated as conditionally independent times given the frailty. This approach can be used both for survival times for individuals, like twins or family members, and for repeated events for the same individual. The standard assumption is to use a gamma distribution for the frailty, but this is a restriction that implies that the dependence is most important for late events. More generally, the distribution can be stable, inverse Gaussian, or follow a power variance function exponential family. Theoretically, large differences are seen between the choices. In practice, using the largest model makes it possible to allow for more general dependence structures, without making the formulas too complicated.},

By solving the maximum likelihood estimates analytically, the dimension of the optimisation problem can be reduced to one both in the case of discrete and continuous data.

It is demanding for statistical practitioners and graduate students to grasp a good knowledge on frailty models from the existing literature. This book provides an in-depth discussion and explanation of the basics of frailty model methodology for such readers. The discussion includes parametric and semiparametric frailty models and accelerated failure time models. Common techniques to fit frailty models include the EM-algorithm, penalised likelihood techniques, Laplacian integration and Bayesian techniques. More advanced frailty models for hierarchical data are also included. Real-life examples are used to demonstrate how particular frailty models can be fitted and how the results should be interpreted.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Sexual differentiation in female mammals can be altered by the proximity of male littermates in utero, a phenomenon known as the intrauterine position effect (IUP). Among simian primates, callitrichines (marmosets and tamarins) are likely candidates for IUP, since they exhibit obligate dizygotic twinning and fetuses share extensive vascularization in utero. In this paper, we determined whether female reproductive parameters are altered by gestating with a male twin and evaluated changes in genes associated with anti-M{\"{u}}llerian and steroid hormones in twinning callitrichine primates. METHODS We assessed the impact of gestation with male cotwins on reproductive performance and survivorship in female marmosets (Callithrix) and lion tamarins (Leontopithecus), contrasting measures for females gestated with one or more littermates (M+) or no male littermates (0M). We compared targeted coding regions for genes involved in steroidal and anti-M{\"{u}}llerian hormone mediation of sexual differentiation for representatives of twinning callitrichines (Callithrix, Saguinus, and Leontopithecus) with closely related New World primates that produce single births (Saimiri and Callimico). RESULTS IUP effects in females were absent in female callitrichine primates: age at first ovulation, average litter size, and the proportion of stillborn infants, and lifetime survivorship did not differ between M+ and 0M females. We documented multiple nonsynonymous substitutions in genes associated with steroid synthesis, transport, and cellular action (SRD5A2, CYP19A1, SHBG, and AR) and with anti-M{\"{u}}llerian hormone (AMH and AMHR2) in callitrichines. In the only callitrichine to produce single infants (Callimico), two genes contained nonsynonymous substitutions relative to twinning callitrichines (CYP19A1 and AMRHR2); these substitutions were identical with nontwinning Saimiri and humans, suggesting a reversion to an ancestral sequence. CONCLUSIONS In spite of a shared placental vasculature with opposite-sex twins throughout embryonic and fetal development, female callitrichine primates gestated with a male cotwin exhibit no decrement in reproductive performance relative to females gestated with female cotwins. Hence, IUP effects on female reproduction in callitrichines are modest. We have identified mutations in candidate genes relevant for steroid hormone signaling and metabolism, and especially in AMH-related genes, that are likely to alter protein structure and function in the callitrichines. These mutations may confer protection for females from the masculinizing and defeminizing influences of gestating with a male cotwin.},

Some of the participants in the workshop were then invited by the present editors to improve, develop, or in some cases thoroughly modify their papers in order to transform them into chapters of a book on life tables. Though life tables are one of the oldest tools in demography, and every textbook on demographic methods deals with the topic of life table construction, few books have dealt with the subject in depth. It is the hope of the editors that the present volume will fulfill to some extent this need. Though primarily written by and for demographers, this book will also be of use to actuaries working in life insurance, and to epidemiologists dealing with morbidity and cause of death. Furthermore, a topic such as competing risks theory should also be of interest to statisticians. The editors wish to thank the other authors of this volume for their involvement and patience. They also express their gratitude to the European Association for Population Studies for its continued interest and support during the preparation of this book. Financial assistance for the initial workshop was provided by the European Union, the French Embassy in Brussels, the National Bank of Belgium, and the University of Louvain. Without the assistance of all these sources, the present volume would never have taken shape.},

STUDY DESIGN The numbers of antepartum stillbirths, intrapartum stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and surviving neonates delivered at between 37 and 43 weeks' gestation in Scotland, 1985-1996, were obtained from national databases (n = 700,878) after exclusion of multiple pregnancies and deaths caused by congenital abnormality. The numbers of deaths at each gestational week were related to appropriate denominators: antepartum stillbirths were related to ongoing pregnancies, intrapartum stillbirths were related to all births (excluding antepartum stillbirths), and neonatal deaths were related to live births. The cumulative probability of perinatal death associated with delivery at each gestational week was estimated by means of life-table analysis. RESULTS The gestational week of delivery associated with the lowest cumulative risk of perinatal death was 38 weeks' gestation, whereas the perinatal mortality rate was lowest at 41 weeks' gestation. The risk of death increased more sharply among primigravid women after 38 weeks' gestation because of a greater risk of antepartum stillbirth. The relationships between risk of death and gestational age were similar for the periods 1985-1990 and 1991-1996. CONCLUSION Delivery at 38 weeks' gestation was associated with the lowest risk of perinatal death.},

The authors propose a new measure to replace fetal and infant mortality and an analytic strategy to assess the effects of risk factors on this outcome. They used 1998 data for US Blacks and Whites. Age-specific post-last menstrual period (LMP) mortality rate was defined as the proportion of deaths (stillbirth, perinatal death, or infant death) at a given age post-LMP. The authors used extended Cox regression with time-varying covariates and hazard ratios to model the effects of race and smoking on post-LMP mortality. Perinatal mortality rates (conventional calculation) for Blacks and Whites showed the expected crossover. However, analyses of post-LMP mortality showed no crossover. For the Black-White comparison, a hazard ratio of 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.67, 1.77) was obtained. The hazard was higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, but the hazard ratio increased from 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.22) at 22 weeks to 1.82 (95% confidence interval: 1.72, 1.92) at 40 weeks. The hazard ratio associated with birth was also time dependent: higher than 1 for preterm gestation and lower than 1 for term gestation. The increasing adverse effect of smoking with gestational age suggests an accumulating effect of smoking on mortality. Modeling post-LMP mortality eliminates the crossover paradox for race and maternal smoking in a single statistical model.},

  abstract = {In multi-state models, it has been the tradition to model all transition intensities on one time scale, usually the time since entry into the study ('clock-forward' approach). The effect of time since an intermediate event has been accommodated either by changing the time scale to time since entry to the new state ('clock-back' approach) or by including the time at entry to the new state as a covariate. In this paper, we argue that the choice of time scale for the various transitions in a multi-state model should be dealt with as an empirical question, as also the question of whether a single time scale is sufficient. We illustrate that these questions are best addressed by using parametric models for the transition rates, as opposed to the traditional Cox-model-based approaches. Specific advantages are that dependence of failure rates on multiple time scales can be made explicit and described in informative graphical displays. Using a single common time scale for all transitions greatly facilitates computations of probabilities of being in a particular state at a given time, because the machinery from the theory of Markov chains can be applied. However, a realistic model for transition rates is preferable, especially when the focus is not on prediction of final outcomes from start but on the analysis of instantaneous risk or on dynamic prediction. We illustrate the various approaches using a data set from stem cell transplant in leukemia and provide supplementary online material in R.},

Although Abraham De Moivre proposed a very simple law as early as 1725 the best known early contribution is probably that of Benjamin Gompertz (1825). Since World War II mathematical formulae have been used to graduate sections of the English Life Tables, as well as assured lives, mortality, and pensioner and annuitant mortality. Reviews of attempts at finding the law of mortality have been given by Elston and Benjamin and Haycocks. A mortality graduation can only be considered successful if the graduated rates progress smoothly from age to age and at the same time they reflect accurately the underlying mortality pattern. In other words, the graduation must smooth out irregularities due to random variation and age misstatement while maintaining all the essential underlying variations in the mortality pattern. In this paper we propose a mathematical expression or law of mortality which we fit to post-war Australian national mortality data.},

The information was collected through a notification system known as "Medical Registration of Births," covering all births occurring in Norway, and the data are made available through the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, which allows for linkage between births and infant deaths. The life table describes the experience of women still pregnant at a gestational age of 16 completed weeks, and states for each subsequent week the number of pregnancy terminations, the outcome, and the number of women still pregnant. Seven outcomes of pregnancy are considered: fetal death prior to labor, fetal death during labor, death within 24 hours, death 1--6 days, death 7--27 days, death 28 days--1 year, and survival of one year or more. The data in the life table provide information on the probability of pregnancy termination in each week of gestation (after 16 completed weeks), and the probabilities of the various outcomes. The fetal-infant life table is considered as an extension of descriptive perinatal statistics and is of value in monitoring health changes and in comparing perinatal mortality between populations. It also provides information on time of pregnancy termination and outcome, which has some clinical applications.},

  abstract = {The consequences to fitness of several types of small age-specific effects on mortality are formulated mathematically. An effect of given form always has a larger consequence, or at least one as large, when it occurs earlier. By reference to a model in which mortality is constant it is shown that this implication cannot be avoided by any conceivable organism. A basis for the theory that senescence is an inevitable outcome of evolution is thus established. The simple theory cannot explain specially high infant mortalities. Fisher's {\textquotedblleft}reproductive value{\textquotedblright}, the form of which gave rise to an erroneous opinion on this point, is shown to be not directly relevant to the situation. Infant mortality may evolve when the early death of one infant makes more likely the creation or survival of a close relative. Similarly, post-reproductive life-spans may evolve when the old animal still benefits its younger relatives. The model shows that higher fertility will be a primary factor leading to the evolution of higher rates of senescence unless the resulting extra mortality is confined to the immature period. Some more general analytical notes on the consequences of modifications to the reproductive schedule are given. Applications to species with populations in continual fluctuation are briefly discussed. Such species apart, it is argued that general stationarity of population can be assumed, in which case the measurement of consequences to fitness in terms of consequences to numerical expectation of offspring is justified. All the age-functions discussed are illustrated by graphs derived from the life-table of the Taiwanese about 1906, and the method of computation is shown.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Survival models accounting for unobserved heterogeneity (frailty models) play an impor- tant role in mortality research, yet there is no article that concisely summarizes useful relationships. OBJECTIVE We present a list of important mathematical relationships that govern populations in which individuals differ from each other in unobserved ways. For some relationships we present proofs that, albeit formal, tend to be simple and intuitive. METHODS We organize the article in a progression, starting with general relationships and then turn- ing to models with stronger and stronger assumptions. RESULTS We start with the general case, in which we do not assume any structure of the underlying baseline hazard, the frailty distribution, or their link to one another. Then we sequentially assume, first, a relative-risk model; second, a gamma distribution for frailty; and, finally, a Gompertz and Gompertz-Makeham specification for baseline mortality. COMMENTS The article might serve as a handy overall reference to frailty models, especially for mor- tality research.},

  abstract      = {This paper is about infant mortality. In line with reliability theory, {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}infant'' refers to the time interval following birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This definition provides a systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a sudden transition falling within the field of application of the Transient Shock (TS) conjecture put forward in Richmond and Roehner (2016c). This conjecture provides predictions about the timing and shape of the death rate peak. It says that there will be a death rate spike whenever external conditions change abruptly and drastically and also predicts that after a steep rise there will be a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process. These predictions can be tested by considering living organisms for which the transient shock occurs several days after birth. Thus, for fish there are three stages: egg, yolk-sac and young adult phases. The TS conjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase and this timing is indeed confirmed by observation. Secondly, the hyperbolic nature of the relaxation process can be tested using very accurate Swiss statistics for postnatal death rates spanning the period from one hour immediately after birth through to age 10 years. It turns out that since the 19\textsuperscript{th} century despite a significant and large reduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-specific death rate has remained basically unchanged. Moreover the hyperbolic pattern observed for humans is also found for small primates as recorded in the archives of zoological gardens. Our overall objective is to identify a series of cases which start from simple systems and move step by step to more complex organisms. The cases discussed here we believe represent initial landmarks in this quest.},

  abstract = {The members of most populations gradually die off or drop out: people die, machines wear out, residents move out, etc. In many such "aging" populations, some members are more likely to "die" than others. Standard analytical methods largely ignore this heterogeneity; the methods assume that all members of a population cohort at a given age face the same probability of death. This paper presents some mathematical methods for studying how the behavior over time of a heterogeneous cohort deviates from the behavior of the individuals that make up the cohort. The methods yield some startling results: individuals age faster than cohorts, eliminating a cause of death can decrease life expectancy, a cohort can suffer a higher death rate than another cohort even though its members have lower death rates, and cohort death rates can be increasing even though its members 'death rates are decreasing.},

(Lancet 1987;1:1192-4) and extended by various researchers is becoming popular in perinatal and pediatric epidemiology. However, the definitions using this concept have led to a puzzling phenomenon in which mortality rates appear to increase monotonically with advancing gestational age. While proponents of this concept have highlighted the rationale for using as the denominator the number of fetuses at risk rather than that of fetuses delivered at a particular gestational week, many have not discussed how the numerator is derived. This article reviews various definitions of gestational-age-specific mortality rates. It points out that the definitions based on the concept of Yudkin et al. are indicators of short-term risk only. Furthermore, the seemingly monotonic positive association between mortality rates and gestational age is a misinterpretation. All of the definitions are valid when used and interpreted correctly. The choice of which definition to adopt depends on the specific issues one attempts to address. Calls for abandoning the conventional definitions are not justified.},

This paper shows that several other distributions have equally simple properties, the main example being the inverse Gaussian distribution. Consequences of the different distributions are examined; the inverse Gaussian makes the population homogeneous with time, whereas for the gamma the relative heterogeneity is constant.},

  abstract = {Mortality is U-shaped with age for many species, declining from birth to sexual maturity, then rising in adulthood, sometimes with postreproductive survival. We show analytically why the optimal life history of a species with determinate growth is likely to have this shape. An organism allocates energy among somatic growth, fertility and maintenance/survival at each age. Adults may transfer energy to juveniles, who can then use more energy than they produce. Optimal juvenile mortality declines from birth to maturity, either to protect the increasingly valuable cumulative investments by adults in juveniles or to exploit the compounding effects of early investment in somatic growth, since early growth raises subsequent energy production, which in turn supports further growth. Optimal adult mortality rises after maturity as expected future reproduction declines as in Hamilton, but intergenerational transfers lead to postreproductive survival as in Lee. Here the Hamilton and transfer effects are divided by probabilities of survival in contrast to the fitness impact measures, which are relevant for mutation-selection balance. If energetic efficiency rises strongly with adult experience, then adult mortality could initially be flat or declining. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The most comprehensive source of US data on fetal deaths of 20 gestational weeks or greater is available through the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The NVSS is a collaborative effort between the independent reporting areas (the individual States and the territories), and the federal government or its agent, the Centers for Disease Control, and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The federal government has no authority to register vital events. The registration of births, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, and divorces is solely a state responsibility. However, NCHS is mandated by law to produce national data based on vital events. To promote the uniformity necessary to create a national file from this decentralized system, NCHS attempts to influence state systems via the development of certain standards, primarily, The Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations (The Model Law), and the Standard Certificates and Reports. The Model Law definitions for live birth, fetal death and induced termination of pregnancy are based on international standards set by The World Health Organization. All states have definitions of fetal death consistent with the Model Law. The Model Law also recommends reporting requirements for fetal death, but state requirements vary. This variation results in differences in reporting of fetal deaths among areas. Other limitations to the national fetal death file include: the under-reporting of fetal deaths incidence, higher than acceptable levels of missing data for some items, and the accuracy of the data reported. Also of concern is the potential misclassification of fetal deaths and short-lived live births. These limitations are amenable to improvement. The upcoming revision of the US Standard Report of Fetal Death addresses these issues and offers an opportunity to strengthen the quality of fetal death data. The development of worksheets, detailed specifications and instruction manuals, and a reformatted cause of death section should importantly enhance the quality of national fetal death file and ultimately reduce the incidence of these tragic events.},

  abstract  = {Background: A decrease in mortality across all ages causes a shift of the age pattern of mortality, or mortality delay, while differences in the rate of decrease across ages cause a change in the shape of the age-at-death distribution, mortality compression or expansion. Evidence exists for both compression and delay of mortality. Existing parametric models to describe the full age pattern of mortality are not able to capture mortality delay versus mortality compression. More recent models that assess delay versus compression mostly focused on the adult or old ages alone and did not distinguish mortality compression below and above the modal age at death, although they represent different mechanisms. Methods: This paper presents a new parametric model that describes the full age pattern of mortality and assesses compression -- at different stages of life -- and delay of mortality: the CoDe model. The model includes 10 parameters, of which five are constant over time. The five time-varying parameters reflect delay of mortality and compression of mortality in infancy, adolescence, young adulthood, late adulthood, and old age. The model describes infant and background mortality by two simple functions, uses a mixed logistic model with different slopes in adult, middle, and old age, and includes the modal age at death as a parameter to account for the delay in mortality. Results: Applying the CoDe model to age-specific probabilities of death for Japanese, French, American, and Danish men and women between 1950 and 2010 showed a very good fit of the full age pattern of mortality. Delay of mortality explained about two-thirds of the increase in life expectancy at birth, whereas compression of mortality due to mortality declines in young age explained about one-third. No strong compression of mortality in late adulthood age was observed. Mortality compression in old age has had a small negative impact on life expectancy. Conclusions: The CoDe model proved a valid instrument for describing the full age pattern of mortality and for disentangling the effects of mortality delay and compression -- at different stages of life -- on the increase in life expectancy.},

Our analysis updates previous studies by UNICEF, the World Bank and the United Nations. It identifies countries and WHO regions where sustained improvement has occurred and those where setbacks are evident. A consistent series of estimates of under-five mortality rate is provided and an indication is given of historical trends during the period 1950--2000 for both developed and developing countries. It is estimated that 10.5 million children aged 0--4 years died in 1999, about 2.2 million or 17.5% fewer than a decade earlier. On average about 15% of newborn children in Africa are expected to die before reaching their fifth birthday. The corresponding figures for many other parts of the developing world are in the range 3--8% and that for Europe is under 2%. During the 1990s the decline in child mortality decelerated in all the WHO regions except the Western Pacific but there is no widespread evidence of rising child mortality rates. At the country level there are exceptions in southern Africa where the prevalence of HIV is extremely high and in Asia where a few countries are beset by economic difficulties. The slowdown in the rate of decline is of particular concern in Africa and South-East Asia because it is occurring at relatively high levels of mortality, and in countries experiencing severe economic dislocation. As the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues in Africa, particularly southern Africa, and in parts of Asia, further reductions in child mortality become increasingly unlikely until substantial progress in controlling the spread of HIV is achieved.},

It represents the culmination of work carried out at the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure over the past quarter-century. Both books use Anglican parish registers to illuminate the population history of England between the sixteenth century and the mid-nineteenth century, for which period they are the prime source available. This second work demonstrates the value of the technique of family reconstitution as a means of obtaining accurate and detailed information about fertility, mortality, and nuptiality in the past. Indeed, more is now known about many aspects of English demography in the parish register period than about the post-1837 period when the Registrar-General collected and published information. Using data from 26 parishes, the authors show clearly that their results are representative not only of the demographic situation of the parishes from which the data were drawn, but also of the country as a whole. While the book largely confirms the earlier findings of the Cambridge Group, many novel and some very surprising features of the behaviour of past populations are brought to light for the first time.},

  abstract  = {The adventure of decomposition methods is the most challenging responsibility that I have encountered so far. I accepted this formidable task because, I believe, it is the key idea of all the methods founded in the core of demography. Decomposition theory is based on the simple principle of separating demographic measures into components that contribute to an understanding of the phenomena under study. Most of the decompositions presented here refer to changes over time in demographic variables. For this reason, this research contributes to the understanding of population dynamics. The principle of decomposition methods is not only applicable to demography, however. All sciences, in one or other way, use decomposition as a research tool. As such, other social and natural sciences could benefit from the results presented in this book.},

  abstract  = {Objective: Timing of delivery for the early preterm small for gestational age (SGA) fetus remains unknown. Our aim was to estimate the risk of stillbirth in the early preterm SGA fetus compared to the risk of neonatal death.
Study Design: We performed a retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies undergoing second trimester anatomy ultrasound excluding fetal anomalies, aneuploidy and pregnancies with incomplete neonatal follow-up. SGA was defined as birthweight  10 th percentile by the Alexander standard. Life-table analysis was used to calculate the cumulative risks of stillbirth/10,000 ongoing SGA pregnancies and risk of neonatal death/10,000 SGA live births for 2 week GA strata in the early preterm period (24-33 and 6/7 weeks). We further examined the composite risk of expectant management and then compared the risk of expectant management with the risk of immediate delivery. 
Results: Of 76,453 singleton pregnancies, 7,036 SGA pregnancies meeting inclusion criteria were ongoing at 24 weeks with 64 stillbirths, 226 live births and 18 neonatal deaths between 24-33 and 6/7 weeks. As the risk of stillbirth increases with advancing GA, the risk of neonatal death falls, until the 32-33 and 6/7 week GA stratum. The relative risk of expectant management compared with immediate delivery remains 1 for each gestational age strata. 
Conclusion: Our findings suggest the balance between the competing risks of stillbirth and neonatal death for the early preterm SGA fetus occurs at 32-33 and 6/7 weeks. These data can be useful when delivery timing remains uncertain.},

The model captures the hazard of neonatal mortality according to the function a*exp($-$g*t) + d, where t represents age. Covariates are allowed to simultaneously influence the initial excess hazard, the rate of decay, and the long-term hazard. Among term newborns, birth length for gestational age had a stronger effect on the long-term hazard and a weaker effect on the initial excess hazard than the Ponderal index. The initial excess hazard associated with a low Ponderal index tended to decay quickly. Among preterm newborns, a higher birth length for gestational age was associated with lower initial and long-term hazards, and with a faster rate of decay of the initial excess hazard. In contrast, the Ponderal index was not associated with the long-term hazard. We discuss the interpretability of the model and its potential use in neonatology and medical demography. We also compare the model to a Cox model with time-dependent covariates.},

At a certain time t0 a cross-sectional sample is taken, generating a sample of current durations (backward recurrence times) of survivors until t0 and a prevalent cohort study consisting of survival times left-truncated at the current durations. A Lexis diagram is helpful in visualizing this situation. Survival analysis based on current durations and prevalent cohort studies is now well-established as long as all covariates are observed. The general problems with unobserved covariates have been well understood for ordinary prospective follow-up studies, with the good help of hazard rate models incorporating frailties: as for ordinary regression models, the added noise generates attenuation in the regression parameter estimates. For prevalent cohort studies this attenuation remains, but in addition one needs to take account of the differential selection of the survivors from initiation t i to cross-sectional sampling at t0 . This paper intends to survey the recent development of these matters and the consequences for routine use of hazard rate models or accelerated failure time models in the many cases where unobserved heterogeneity may be an issue. The study was inspired by concrete problems in the study of time-to-pregnancy, and we present various simulation results inspired by this particular application.},

  abstract  = {Today, we know that demographic rates can be greatly influenced by differences among individuals in their capacity to survive and reproduce. These intrinsic differences, commonly known as individual heterogeneity, can rarely be measured and are thus treated as latent variables when modeling mortality. Finite mixture models and mixed effects models have been proposed as alternative approaches for inference on individual heterogeneity in mortality. However, in general models assume that individual heterogeneity influences mortality proportionally, which limits the possibility to test hypotheses on the effect of individual heterogeneity on other aspects of mortality such as ageing rates. Here, we propose a Bayesian model that builds upon the mixture models previously developed, but that facilitates making inferences on the effect of individual heterogeneity on mortality parameters other than the baseline mortality. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the Gompertz--Makeham mortality model, commonly used in human and wildlife studies, by assuming that the Gompertz rate parameter is affected by individual heterogeneity. We provide results of a simulation study where we show that the model appropriately retrieves the parameters used for simulation, even for low variances in the heterogeneous parameter. We then apply the model to a dataset on captive chimpanzees and on a cohort life table of 1751 Swedish men, and show how model selection against a null model (i.e., without heterogeneity) can be carried out.},

  abstract  = {Gerontology focuses on deterioration with increasing age, but in most populations most variables, including survival probability, improve at early ages (ontogenescence) before deteriorating at advanced ages (senescence). The extent to which gerontology needs to consider this U-shaped pattern of risk over age depends upon the mechanistic, demographic and evolutionary links and interactions between ontogenescence and senescence. In reading the literature on both senescence and ontogenescence, and in interacting with other biogerontologists, we have encountered a set of what we view as inaccurate or oversimplified claims about ontogenescence, its relationship to senescence and its importance to gerontology. Here, after briefly introducing ontogenescence, we address four of these claims. We demonstrate the counterfactual nature of Claim 1. Ontogenescence is an environmental effect largely absent in protected environments. We then briefly review the literature which leads to Claim 2. Senescence and ontogenescence are parts of the same phenomenon, and describe why we reject this view. We then explain why the rejection of Claim 2 does not necessarily support Claim 3, the idea that senescence and ontogenescence are easily separable. Finally, we examine Claim 4. Gerontologists don{\textquoteright}t need to think about ontogenescence, and give some examples of why we consider this misguided.},

  abstract  = {Background. Risk-adjusted severity of illness is frequently used in clinical research and quality assessments. Although there are multiple methods designed for neonates, they have been infrequently compared and some have not been assessed in large samples of very low birth weight (VLBW; 1500 g) infants.

Objectives. To test and compare published neonatal mortality prediction models, including Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB), Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP), SNAP-Perinatal Extension (SNAP-PE), Neonatal Therapeutic Interventions Scoring System, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) network model, and other individual admission factors such as birth weight, low Apgar score (7 at 5 minutes), and small for gestational age status in a cohort of VLBW infants from the Washington, DC area.

Methods. Data were collected on 476 VLBW infants admitted to 8 neonatal intensive care units between October 1994 and February 1997. The calibration (closeness of total observed deaths to the predicted total) of models with published coefficients (SNAP-PE, CRIB, and NICHD) was assessed using the standardized mortality ratio. Discrimination was quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic curves. Calibrated models were derived for the current database using logistic regression techniques. Goodness-of-fit of predicted to observed probabilities of death was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.

Results. The calibration of published algorithms applied to our data was poor. The standardized mortality ratios for the NICHD, CRIB, and SNAP-PE models were .65, .56, and .82, respectively. Discrimination of all the models was excellent (range: .863--.930). Surprisingly, birth weight performed much better than in previous analyses, with an AUC of .869. The best models using both 12- and 24-hour postadmission data, significantly outperformed the best model based on birth data only but were not significantly different from each other. The variables in the best model were birth weight, birth weight squared, low 5-minute Apgar score, and SNAP (AUC = .930).

Conclusion. Published models for severity of illness overpredicted hospital mortality in this set of VLBW infants, indicating a need for frequent recalibration. Discrimination for these severity of illness scores remains excellent. Birth variables should be reevaluated as a method to control for severity of illness in predicting mortality.},

The predictive value for mortality of gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, clinical risk index for babies II score, and first and lowest serum albumin levels was assessed by calculating the associated area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The overall survival and mortality rates of groups I, II, and III were 81.0% (457/564), 7.6% (43/564), and 11.4% (64/564), respectively. Birth weight, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, and first serum albumin levels were significantly higher, while the clinical risk index for babies II score was significantly lower in group I when compared to groups II and III. Gestational age and lowest serum albumin level in group I were significantly higher than group III, but not group II. However, gestational age, birth weight, and clinical risk index for babies II score showed gestational age dependent variations regardless of survival or mortality. Apgar score at 5 min (0.756) and lowest serum albumin level (0.771) demonstrated the highest AUC of the ROC curve in predicting mortality in group II and III, respectively. In conclusion, Apgar score at 5 min and lowest serum albumin level were the most effective predictors for mortality in extremely low birth weight infants during $\leq$ 7\textsuperscript{th} and > 7\textsuperscript{th} postnatal days, respectively.},

  abstract  = {The widely-known Gompertz law of mortality states the exponential increase of mortality with age in human populations. Such an exponential increase is observed at the adulthood span, roughly after the reproductive period, while mortality data at young and extremely old ages deviate from it. The heterogeneity of human populations, i.e. the existence of subpopulations with different mortality dynamics, is a useful consideration that can explain age-dependent mortality patterns across the whole life-course. A simple mathematical model combining the heterogeneity of populations with an assumption that the mortality in each subpopulation grows exponentially with age has been proven to be capable of reproducing the entire mortality pattern in a human population including the observed peculiarities at early- and late-life intervals. In this work we fit this model to actual (Swedish) mortality data for consecutive periods and consequently describe the evolution of mortality dynamics in terms of the evolution of the model parameters over time. We have found that the evolution of the model parameters validates the applicability of the compensation law of mortality to each subpopulation separately. Furthermore, our study has indicated that the population structure changes so that the population tends to become more homogeneous over time. Finally, our analysis of the decrease of the overall mortality in a population over time has shown that this decrease is mainly due to a change in the population structure and to a lesser extent to a reduction of mortality in each of the subpopulations, the latter being represented by an alteration of the parameters that outline the exponential dynamics.},

It has been verified for many non-human species in ecology, and recently, for Norway{\textquoteright}s human population. In this article, we test TL for human mortality.

Methods: We use death counts and exposures by single age (0 to 100) and calendar year (1960 to 2009) for countries of the Human Mortality Database to compute death rates as well as their rates of change in time. For both mortality measures, we test temporal forms of TL: In cross-age-scenarios, we analyze temporal variance to mean relationships at different ages in a certain country, and in cross-country-scenarios, we analyze temporal variance to mean relationships in different countries at a certain age.

Results: The results reveal almost log-linear variance to mean relationships in both scenarios; exceptions are the cross-country-scenarios for the death rates, which appear to be clustered together, due to similar mortality levels among the countries.

Conclusions: TL appears to describe a regular pattern in human mortality. We suggest that it might be used (1) in mortality forecasting (to evaluate the quality of forecasts and to justify linear mortality assumptions) and (2) to reveal minimum mortality at some ages.},

TL has been observed in spatiotemporal contexts for the population density of hundreds of species including humans. TL also describes temporal variation in human mortality in developed countries, but no explanation has been proposed.

Objective: To understand why and to what extent TL describes temporal variation in human mortality, we examine whether the mortality models of Gompertz, Makeham, and Siler are consistent with TL. We also examine how strongly TL differs between observed and modeled mortality, between women and men, and among countries.

Methods: We analyze how well each mortality model explains TL fitted to observed occurrence--exposure death rates by comparing three features: the log--log linearity of the temporal variance as a function of the temporal mean, the age profile, and the slope of TL. We support some empirical findings from the Human Mortality Database with mathematical proofs.

Results: TL describes modeled mortality better than observed mortality and describes Gompertz mortality best. The age profile of TL is closest between observed and Siler mortality. The slope of TL is closest between observed and Makeham mortality. The Gompertz model predicts TL with a slope of exactly 2 if the modal age at death increases linearly with time and the parameter that specifies the growth rate of mortality with age is constant in time. Observed mortality obeys TL with a slope generally less than 2. An explanation is that, when the parameters of the Gompertz model are estimated from observed mortality year by year, both the modal age at death and the growth rate of mortality with age change over time.

Conclusions: TL describes human mortality well in developed countries because their mortality schedules are approximated well by classical mortality models, which we have shown to obey TL.

Contribution: We provide the first theoretical linkage between three classical demographic models of mortality and TL.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND
The 10-point Apgar score has been used to assess the condition and prognosis of newborn infants throughout the world for almost 50 years. Some investigators have proposed that measurement of pH in umbilical-artery blood is a more objective method of assessing newborn infants.

METHODS
We carried out a retrospective cohort analysis of 151,891 live-born singleton infants without malformations who were delivered at 26 weeks of gestation or later at an inner-city public hospital between January 1988 and December 1998. Paired Apgar scores and umbilical-artery blood pH values were determined for 145,627 infants to assess which test best predicted neonatal death during the first 28 days after birth.

RESULTS
For 13,399 infants born before term (at 26 to 36 weeks of gestation), the neonatal mortality rate was 315 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3, as compared with 5 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10. For 132,228 infants born at term (37 weeks of gestation or later), the mortality rate was 244 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3, as compared with 0.2 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10. The risk of neonatal death in term infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3 (relative risk, 1460; 95 percent confidence interval, 835 to 2555) was eight times the risk in term infants with umbilical-artery blood pH values of 7.0 or less (relative risk, 180; 95 percent confidence interval, 97 to 334).

CONCLUSIONS
The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal survival today as it was almost 50 years ago.},

The study of the hump shape reveals age, period, and cohort effects, suggesting that it is formed by a complex combination of different forces of biological and socioeconomic nature. Male and female humps share some traits in all-cause shape and trend, but they also differ by their overall magnitude and cause-specific contributions. Notably, among males, the contributions of traffic and other accidents were progressively replaced by those of suicides, homicides, and poisonings; among females, traffic accidents remained the major contributor to the hump.},

  abstract = {The rate of mortality increase with age tends to slow down at very old ages. One explanation proposed for this deceleration is the selective survival of healthier individuals to older ages. Data on mortality in Sweden and Japan are generally compatible with three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) decelerations for most major causes of death; (2) decelerations starting at younger ages for more {\textquotedblleft}selective{\textquotedblright} causes; and (3) a shift of the deceleration to older ages with declining levels of mortality. A parametric model employed to illustrate the third prediction relies on the distinction between senescent and background mortality. This dichotomy, though simplistic, helps to explain the observed timing of the deceleration.},

  abstract = {Placental abruption is an uncommon obstetric complication associated with high perinatal mortality rates. The authors explored the associations of abruption with fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal survival. The study was based on 7,508,655 singleton births delivered in 1995 and 1996 in the United States. Abruption was recorded in 6.5 per 1,000 births. Perinatal mortality was 119 per 1,000 births with abruption compared with 8.2 per 1,000 among all other births. The high mortality with abruption was due, in part, to its strong association with preterm delivery; 55% of the excess perinatal deaths with abruption were due to early delivery. Furthermore, babies in the lowest centile of weight (<1% adjusted for gestational age) were almost nine times as likely to be born with abruption than those in the heaviest (> or =90%) birth weight centiles. This relative risk progressively declined with higher birth weight centiles. After controlling for fetal growth restriction and early delivery, the high risk of perinatal death associated with abruption persisted. Even babies born at 40 weeks of gestation and birth weight of 3,500-3,999 g (where mortality was lowest) had a 25-fold higher mortality with abruption. The link between fetal growth restriction and abruption suggests that the origins of abruption lie at least in midpregnancy and perhaps even earlier.},
